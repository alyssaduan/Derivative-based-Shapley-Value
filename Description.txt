To apply DerSHAP, the core function is contained in "DerSHAP.py".
For this function, the input is the gradient vector of function and the output is the normalized DerSHAP values. 
For the examples we provided, the gradient vector is calculated using finite difference method. 
Users can use any finite difference method.  
In our examples, we simply call the function from the activesubspace package. For details, see (https://github.com/paulcon/active_subspaces)
