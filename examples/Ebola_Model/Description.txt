This is a modified SEIR model for the spread of Ebola in Western Africa. 
A detailed description of the model is given in Diaz et al. (2018) where the activity score method was used to perform the global sensitivity analysis of the model. 

The SEIR model is a system of seven differential equations which describe the dynamics of disease within a population. 
We are interested in estimating the basic reproduction number, which is a metric measuring how many new cases of disease each current case causes. 
Using the steady state solution and the next generation matrix, Diaz et al. (2018) \cite{diaz2018modified} shows that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is:

$$
R_0 = \left(\beta_1 + \frac{\beta_2\rho_1\gamma_1}{\omega} + \frac{\beta_3}{\gamma_2}\psi\right)/\left(\gamma_1 + \psi \right).
$$

The Jupyter notebook provided is based on the example from Paul Constantine.
