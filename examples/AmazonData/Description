The data, which is from Kaggle\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/code/gcmadhan/amazon-stock-prediction-nn-fbprophet}}, 
is the Amazon stock price data from Jan. 4, 2010 to Dec 30, 2016, with 1233 observations in total. 
The training data contains the opening price, closing price, low price, high price and volume of the stock with 863 observations.
The problem is to estimate the closing price (the target), from the remaining data (the features), using a machine learning algorithm. 
In the notation of the previous sections, the output of the model, $f(\textbf{x})$, is the closing price, and $\textbf{x}$ is the input features.
In this example we use a linear regression model to obtain $f(\textbf{x})$, and use the Amazon stock data to train the model.
