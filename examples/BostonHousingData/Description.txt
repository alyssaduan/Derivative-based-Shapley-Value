The data, which is from Kaggle\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing}}, consists of 489 data points where there are eight features: LSTAT (\% lower status of the population), INDUS (proportion of non-retail business acres per town), NOX (nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)), PTRATIO (pupil-teacher ratio by town), RM (average number of rooms per dwelling, TAX (full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000), DIS (weighted distances to five Boston employment centres), AGE (proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940). The target, $f(\textbf{x})$, is MEDV (median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s). 
Using the data we train two different models, support vector regression (SVR) and gradient boosting regression (GBR). The mean and standard deviation of the mean square error for the SVR model is $-0.04 (+/- 0.03)$ and the GBR model is $-0.03 (+/- 0.02)$.
